orig sent (0):	i really wanted to like this film as i have admiration for italian rip off cinema \( especially jaws rip offs ! \) , but the simple fact of the matter is that monster shark is n't very good all the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there we 've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema , lamberto bava , in the director 's chair one of the best ridiculous cult actors , michael sopkiw , taking the lead role , and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it 's money , yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale the fact that the ' monster shark ' does n't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design , but there 's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it the plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of florida \( or rather , somewhere in italy \) where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing it 's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before , and it 's up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive ! br br the main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless , and since there is little in the way of characters or plot development , even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long this sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant , although the fun element of films such as ' the last shark ' and ' killer fish ' is unfortunately absent for most of the running time the thing i love about lead actor michael sopkiw is that he always seems like he 's taking himself seriously no matter what film he 's in \( although he only ever made four \) this is certainly the case here , although bava never really allows him to completely dive in , and often he feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters sup american lager , and it 's not very fascinating although bava does manage to come good by the end with an entertaining flurry of action as the central monster finally gets to wreak havoc upon its would be captors overall , there really is n't much to recommend this film for as mentioned , i really like this sort of stuff and even i found myself bored on numerous occasions for hardcore italian horror fans only !

not a whole lot br br what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns , but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters ' high hopes for making in ` the big city ' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated , and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities i am unsure of whether or not hoeger 's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight , but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light , he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films , hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he 's shooting , that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider if hoeger actually lived here , you 'd think he 'd know better than that br br all in all , i am completely disappointed in hoeger 's first big film , and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought provoking

she comes in the form of amy lear \( played by the beautiful meredith monroe \) she is actually a likable character , as opposed to the ever so abrasive matt sabo , so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first but , of course , the inevitable comes to pass she falls for him , changes his attitude towards everything , and all seems good and happy but now it 's time for conflict ! br br earlier in the movie , amy makes it clear to matt that she does n't want to score with him , because it would be ` shameful ' to her and her mother this is much to matt 's dismay , and his football buddies \( yes , they eventually warm up to him \) who bet him he would n't get any but , of course , matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he 's not all about the nookie here 's where the exciting plot thickens if you do n't want me to ruin this surprise , then skip ahead br br begin spoiler br br matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the all star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria \( which is baffling in the first place \) and make it to the big city suddenly realizing he 's been used and that his love was a sham , matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before ` the big game ' amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time , but he 's too hot headed to buy it so what will matt do \? will he take her back \? or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all round jerk \? i wo n't ruin the super ultra surprising ending for you br br end spoiler br br so , if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie , please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm this movie is an uninspired version of ` varsity blues ' or ` summer catch ' and that 's not saying much there 's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about so what do you have left \? not a whole lot br br what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns , but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters ' high hopes for making in ` the big city ' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated , and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities i am unsure of whether or not hoeger 's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight , but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light , he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films , hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he 's shooting , that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider if hoeger actually lived here , you 'd think he 'd know better than that br br all in all , i am completely disappointed in hoeger 's first big film , and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought provoking

orig sent (1):	we see at the beginning of little dieter needs to fly dieter dengler , the subject of the film , an obsessive compulsive or at least that 's what he seems to be by way of constantly opening closing doors and with his large stock pile of food in the cellar in a way director werner herzog sets up a central question , in a manner of speaking , to why dieter is like this well , in fact , he 's not necessarily obsessive compulsive as he is just , well , prepared and why should n't he be after the life he 's lived \?

orig sent (1):	this film is a great rampage of action and comedy , it gets right in to it right from the start , there 's no boring build up the chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending , even though my suspicions were not satisfied the special effects worked brilliantly and were believable ! would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions the story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details , to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment br br
